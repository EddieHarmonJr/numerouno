    <h1>A short history of Mark-up and the WWW</h1>


    <h2>In the beginning...</h2>

    <p>The Internet and email have both been around for some time now. 
    The initial Internet was actually developed by the US military 
    as a means of communication that was impossible to break! It was 
    thought that if there were thousands of communication points 
    (<em>rather than just a few transmitters</em>) then it would be possible 
    to transmit a message even when many communication points had 
    been destroyed. No-one imagined that the Internet would become 
    a house-hold tool for many people throughout the world!</p>


    <h2>The World-Wide-Web</h2>

    <p>Until 1989, <strong>the Internet was primarily used by computer geeks</strong> 
    who knew all the required tools and commands. But everything 
    changed when Tim Berners-Lee of the CERN nuclear research facility 
    near Geneva, Switzerland, introduced Hypertext documents.</p>

    <p>Hypertext documents made it very simple to follow links to related 
    information, regardless of which country the information is stored 
    in - all that was required was a single click of the mouse! Yet 
    these links also had an implication for the way people would read 
    the information...</p>
