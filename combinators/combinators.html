        Beihai Park, Beijing A dragon is a legendary creature, typically scaled or fire-spewing and with serpentine, reptilian
        or avian traits, that features in the myths of many cultures around world. The two most well-known cultural traditions
        of dragon are The European dragon, derived from European folk traditions and ultimately related to Balkans and Western
        Asian mythologies. Most are depicted as reptilian creatures with animal-level intelligence, and are uniquely six-limbed
        (four legs and a separate set of wings). The Chinese dragon, with counterparts in Japan (namely the Japanese dragon),
        Korea and other East Asian and South Asian countries.[1] Most are depicted as serpentine creatures with above-average
        intelligence, and are quadrupeds (four legs and wingless). The two traditions may have evolved separately, but have
        influenced each other to a certain extent, particularly with the cross-cultural contact of recent centuries. The
        English word dragon and Latin word draco derive from Greek δράκων (drákōn), "dragon, serpent of huge size, water-snake".[2]

    <h2>Dragons are a mythical creature of ancient times</h2>
    <div id="content">
    <p>In Jewish religious texts, the first mention of a dragon-like creature is in the Biblical works of Job (26:13), and Isaiah
        (27:1) where it is called Nachash Bare'ach, or a "Pole Serpent".[30] This is identified in the Midrash Rabba to Genesis
        1:21 as Leviathan from the word Taninim (תנינים) "and God created the great sea-monsters."[31] In modern Hebrew,
        the word Taninim is used for crocodiles but this is a 20th-century usage unconnected with the original Biblical meaning.[citation
        needed] In later Biblical texts, the Book of Isaiah, the Book of Job, and Psalm 89 refer to a sea-demon called Rahab
        (not to be confused with Rahab, the woman of Jericho mentioned in the Book of Joshua). Isaiah 51:9 equates this Rahab
        with a dragon or monster. "Rahab" is the English transliteration of רהב (reb) with the several meanings: pride, a
        mythical sea-monster, or Egypt (as an emblematic name).[32] In the Douay-Rheims version, translated via Medieval
        Latin from the Vulgate, the word reb is rendered "the proud one" in Isaiah 51:9 and Job 26:12 and "the power of the
        sea" in Psalm 88:10 (Psalm 88 is equivalent to Psalm 89 in other versions due to different verse numbering in the
        Vulgate). The connection between the sea-monster and "Leviathan the serpent" is made in Isaiah 27:1.[33] In Jewish
        astronomy, this is also identified with the North Pole, the star Thuban which, around 4,500 years ago, was the star
        in the Draco constellation's "tail".[30] However this can also have been either the celestial pole or the ecliptic
        pole. The ancient observers noted that Draco was at the top of the celestial pole, giving the appearance that stars
        were "hanging" from it, and in Hebrew it is referred to as Teli, from talah (תלה) – to hang.[34] Hebrew writers from
        Arabic-speaking locations identified the Teli as Al Jaz'har, which is a Persian word for a "knot" or a "node" because
        of the intersection of the inclination of the orbit of a planet from the elliptic that forms two such nodes. In modern
        astronomy. these are called the ascending node and the descending node, but in medieval astronomy they were referred
        to as "dragon's head" and "dragon's tail".[35] The Merthyr Synagogue features a dragon on the front gable.

    <p>In China, depiction of the dragon (traditional:龍; simplified:龙) can be found in artifacts from the Shang and Zhou dynasties
        with examples dating back to the 16th century BC.[37] Archaeologist Zhōu Chong-Fa believes that the Chinese word
        for dragon is an onomatopoeia of the sound of thunder.[38] The Chinese name for dragon is pronounced lóng in Mandarin
        Chinese[37] or lùhng in Cantonese.[39] Sometime after the 9th century AD, Japan adopted the Chinese dragon through
        the spread of Buddhism.[37] Although the indigenous name for a dragon in Japanese is tatsu (たつ), a few of the Japanese
        words for dragon stem from the Chinese word for dragon, namely, ryū (りゅう) or ryō (りょう) (traditional: 龍; simplified:
        竜).[37] The Vietnamese word for dragon is rồng (龍) and the Korean word for dragon is ryong (hangul:용, hanja:龍). The
        Chinese dragon (simplified Chinese: 龙; traditional Chinese: 龍; pinyin: lóng) is the highest-ranking animal in the
        Chinese animal hierarchy, strongly associated at one time with the emperor and hence power and majesty (the mythical
        bird fenghuang was the symbol of the Chinese empress), still recognized and revered. Its origins are vague, but its
        "ancestors can be found on Neolithic pottery as well as Bronze Age ritual vessels."[40] Tradition has it composed
        of nine different animals, with nine sons, each with its own imagery and affiliations. It is the only mythological
        animal of the 12 animals that represent the Chinese calendar. 2012 was the Chinese year of the Water Dragon.
